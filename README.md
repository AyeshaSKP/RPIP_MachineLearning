# RPIP_MachineLearning
 Project at Hong Kong PolyU to identify the pathogeneticity of the respiratory pathogens.

 This research project has been conducted at the Hong Kong Polytechnique University during my employment at the HTI(Health Informatics Department).

Little bit about the dataset, data cleaning and feature extraction: The dataset of 138 samples generated by the Ilumina have been given by the major hospitals and lab in Hong Kong. The main dataset contains more than 20 dependent vaiables but for the purpose of this project three variables have been chosen and they are microorganism name,speciman type and class type. The dataset has been cleaned from through replaching null and missing values through replaching them by 0. From the given FASTQ sequence, seven types of encoding features have been extrcated and they are amino acid composition (AAC), Dipeptide Composition (DPC), autocorrelation, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) ,blosum 62, pseudo nucleic acid composition or PseNAC and physicochemical property or PP.
